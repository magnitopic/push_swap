# Python testing

In order to solve Push_Swap I wanted to break down the problem into separate steps.
First I'd need to understand what sort of algorithm I'm going to use. So I take a look at dynamic programing.
Next I'll need to program that algorithm in Python, just so I don't have to bother with handling memory.
Finally do the project in C and check that I have every thing the subject asks of me.

## Part 1: Dynamic programing

-   fibonacci.py - given a number it returns that position of the fibonacci sequence
-   gridTraveler.py - given a grid of `x,y`, you must travel form the top left corner to the bottom right corner. You can only move down or right. How many ways can you travel the grid?
-   canSum.py - given a number and an array of numbers, you must return True or False if it is posible sum the first number with the numbers in the array. You can repeat the same number as much as you want
-   howSum.py - given a number and an array of numbers, you must return an array of numbers that sum the first number. You can repeat the same number as much as you want
-   bestSum.py - given a number and an array of numbers, you must return an array of numbers that sum the first number. You can repeat the same number as much as you want. You must return the shortest array
