# Python testing

In order to solve Push_Swap I wanted to break down the problem into separate steps.
First I'd need to understand what sort of algorithm I'm going to use. So I take a look at dynamic programing.
Next I'll need to program that algorithm in Python, just so I don't have to bother with handling memory.
Finally do the project in C and check that I have every thing the subject asks of me.
