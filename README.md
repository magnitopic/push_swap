# Push Swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

# Program

## Initial installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnitopic/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Compilation and execution

```bash
make
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

## Count amount of moves

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1 | wc -l
```

## Counting execution time

```bash
time ./push_swap 3 2 1
```

# Checker program

The **bonus** part of the project is to develop a checker program for the mandatory part. This program will receive the numbers and the instructions from the standard input and will check if the numbers are sorted.

```bash
make bonus
./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker 3 2 1
```

# Online visualizer

You can run Push_swap in [this online visualizer.](https://push-swap-visualizer.vercel.app)

Execute the program with the numbers the page generates and place the output in a file.
You can later upload it and see the execution of the program.

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 5 4 1 > result
```
